Personal Business Website

This was a first attempt at a website.  Completed in 2005, it is a functioning 4-page website that features a slideshow and a no-longer-functioning video.  It was completed with a legacy program called Visual Page, developed by Symantec.  The program was bundled with Norton Antivirus and offered a proto-WYSIWYG display of the website under construction.

Before GitHub, the files and versions were managed with another legacy program called Cute FTP and uploaded to the server. The website was then tested on several different browsers and screen sizes.  I also conducted additional file management and thumbnail creation for image files.

Prior to the advent of React, the website uses framesets to create persistent navigation.  It also lacks stylesheets, as not all browsers supported them at the time.  It was designed to make simple image file changes and reduce maintenance.  Its purpose was low-cost marketing for our photography business and simple and quick management.  At the time, a career in coding was not my focus.

It always had trouble with SEO, but it often returned on the first page of Google Search, if not the second.
